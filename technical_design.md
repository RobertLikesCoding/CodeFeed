## Technical Design

### 1. System Architecture

- Frontend: React with Redux for state management
- API: Reddit API for fetching posts

### 2. Component Structure

- App (main component)
- SearchBar (search for keywords)
- PostList (list of posts)
- PostItem (individual post)
- SubredditList (list of subreddits)
- Subreddit (image and link to subreddit)
- CategoryFilter (filtering by Frontend, Backend, Fullstack)
- OPTIONAL: SavedPosts (saved posts)

### 3. Data Flow

- Redux Store for global state
- Actions for API calls and state updates
- Reducers for state manipulation

### 4. API Integration

- Use of Reddit API to fetch relevant subreddits
- Error handling for API requests

### 5. Responsive Design

- Use of CSS Flexbox and media queries
- Mobile-first approach

### 6. Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading for images and components

### 7. Testing Strategy

- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Selenium for end-to-end tests

### 9. Deployment

- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Hosting on Netlify
